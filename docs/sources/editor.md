# Yugabyte query editor

In Grafana, querying data from your Yugabyte database can be accomplished through two primary methods: The Query Builder and The Raw Query Editor.

## Query Builder:
The query builder provides a visual interface for constructing queries. It simplifies the process by allowing users to select tables, specify rows, and apply filters using an intuitive graphical interface. This is particularly useful for users who prefer a more guided approach and are less familiar with SQL syntax.

## Raw Query Editor:
For users seeking more advanced querying capabilities or those with a deeper understanding of SQL, the raw query editor offers the flexibility to directly write SQL queries. This allows users to create complex queries that may not be supported by the query builder.
